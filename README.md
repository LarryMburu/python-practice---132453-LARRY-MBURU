code explanations

1. sum_list.py
//so what this function does is that it takes a list of numbers and then adds all of them using the function call sum_list(numbers) which has already beed fdefined before being called
//which means 1+2+3+4+5 = 15, but now itll be done using the method

2. check_if_even_or_odd.py
//this method checks for a number whether it is even or odd by subjecting it to a "divisibility by 2" check. so if its divisible by 2, it is even number, eif it is not then it is odd number
//.is_integer() is a function that checks if the result of the division is a whole number
//in this case, 7 will be Odd and 4 will be Even

3. loop_using_factorial.py
//I created a function called factorial_loop(n) that accepts a number n and set result = 1, because thats the starting point. If its set at 0 it'll be 0 * n which is still a 0 hence why I looped from 1 up to and including n:
//next I put a range (for i in range(1, n+1)) so that it can count numbers forward i.e 1, 2, 3, ..., upto n. these values of n are what will be used to multiply at the function result *= i which means result = result * i each time.
//after the loop finishes, it'll return the value of result, which now holds the factorial value.

4. recursive_factorial_.py
//this function works by calling itself (recursion) for as long as the conditions are met (if n == 0 or n == 1:)
